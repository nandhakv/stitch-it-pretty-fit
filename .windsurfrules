1 - When user message starts with API means user is asking about the API structure for a particular
service. In this case, you should provide the API structure for the service like request and response.
and endpoint which is needed in the format for copying.

2 - React Coding Guidelines for Windsurf Editor:

# Project Structure

- Organize by features (components/editor, components/elements, hooks, contexts, state, services, utils)
- Group related components in domain-specific folders

# Component Design

- Use small, focused functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implement Redux Toolkit for global editor state
- Create custom hooks for editor-specific logic (useCanvas, useSelection)
- Design controlled components for interactive elements
- Create reusable components for common UI patterns where possible
- Use memoization for performance optimization

# Styling

- Use CSS Modules or Styled Components for scoped styling
- Follow consistent naming conventions (BEM recommended)
- Design intuitive visual cues for editor interactions

# Code Quality

- Configure ESLint and Prettier for consistent formatting
- Use meaningful naming and concise code
- Add comments for complex editor logic
- Follow DRY principle by extracting reusable editor functions

# Editor-Specific Data

- Define clear TypeScript interfaces for windsurf elements
- Implement efficient canvas data representation
- Create serialization/deserialization utilities for designs
- Build undo/redo functionality using state snapshots

# Performance

- Optimize canvas rendering with selective updates
- Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implement efficient element property updates

# Testing

- Write unit tests for individual editor components
- Create integration tests for tool interactions
- Implement end-to-end tests for key editor workflows

# Editor-Specific Features

- Build robust geometric calculation utilities
- Design intuitive user interactions for manipulating elements
- Implement clear tool management system
- Create intuitive layer management if supported

4 - Clean up the dead and unused code after each iteration.
